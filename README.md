Netbeans project: sportSunday v1.0

Hello, hello! I am just a little java program, trying to impress you! My design is based on 
model-view-controller pattern and my GUI was made with swing API.

My job is to manage sports tournaments. I am programmed to believe that modesty isn't just for
average ones but a significant virtue. Therefore, I 'll be laconic on describing my features.

First of all, to provide you the abiltity of persistent storage of your data, you should first 
create an empty folder with the name "serializationFolder" at C:. Every time the program is 
launched, it will load your data from "greekSportsObject.ser" file which is in folder: 
C:\serializationFolder.

My basic capabilities:

*** Competitors screen!

    Create teams and athletes and storage them at my "database" (I prefer serialization rather than 
    a classic DB). I am not trying to be hip, it’s Just that my creator had already experimented with
    DBs and he firmly believes that serialization is an efficient and elegant way of storing data. 
    Because of him, I am now the weirdo kid!

*** Championship screen!

    Create, adjust their characteristics and manage tournaments for sports (currently basketball, 
    soccer, ping pong, tennis and volleyball are supported).In version 1, only two types of 
    championships are available, cup and league and each one has only one round. The guy that made 
    me promised that I 'll become more flexible when I grow up. It sux to be a kid! 
    Too many restrictions. 

*** Participations screen!

    Register competitors (teams or solists) to the existing championships. Easy peasy for you but I 
    am the dogsbody doing the hard work behind the scenes.

*** Report screen!

    That's my fanciest talent. I provide lottery of schedule, schedule where you can register scores, 
    statistics table, 4 ways of sorting the statistics table. You can change some score and after just 
    some milliseconds everything has been updated. But my dad is really proud of my lottery algorithm. 
    You should check it out (package: lotteryClasses),it is fully commented. Well, report screen is 
    supported in this version only for basketball and football sport events. Wait for v2.0!

-----> I am sure you have noticed that I can track and fix every clumsy move of yous on every screen. 
       I have too much error checking code built in just to look after dummies like you :P
       
That's all for now...
